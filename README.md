# eagle-library
This is just a small repo to keep copies of my eagle library.  Right now it
is just a vertical mount female scart connector and a 4pdt slide switch, both
used for modifying crt television sets to accept RGBS over SCART.

I may also upload a scart switch I'm working on, but not sure about that yet.
